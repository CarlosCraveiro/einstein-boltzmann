# The Einstein-Boltzmann Board

This Board was intended to be used with the Guide of the 5-th EPO (2017)

So the schematic ideia is not mine, I just adapt and documented it so I could
manufacture the board.

The DRC Custom Rules used on this project came from [this repo](https://gist.github.com/darkxst/f713268e5469645425eed40115fb8b4).

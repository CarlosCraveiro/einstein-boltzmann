# The Einstein-Boltzmann Board

This Board was intended to be used with the Guide of the 5-th EPO (2017)

So this design is not mine, I just adapt and documented it so I could
manufacture the board.

TODO: Come up with a LICENSE (I'm thinking to use CERN's Open Hardware
Licence, but that's something for later).

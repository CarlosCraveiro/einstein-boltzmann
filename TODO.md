# Project's TO-DO List:

- [ ] Add a Ground Plane on top of the board

- [ ] Increase Via and track size

- [x] Place the decoupling capacitors closer to the components

- [x] Place "user interface" pins together and close to the edges

- [x] Do something to avoid needing of four 9V batteries

- [ ] Increase via spacing

- [ ] Avoid unnecessary 90-degree tracks

- [ ] Reduce silk resistor size

- [ ] Improve "informativeness" of the labels on the board

- [x] Change the 10u capacitors to polyester ones (change the silk)

- [ ] Reduce board size a little, but maintaining golden ratio
